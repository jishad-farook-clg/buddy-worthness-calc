# 🧠 buddy-worthness-calc-backend

> 🖥️ The backend API for the *world's most unnecessary* body part valuation system.

This is the Django-based backend for **buddy-worthness-calc**, a humorous app that analyzes a user's image and returns a fictional breakdown of their body's monetary worth. The backend doesn't use real AI — just some random logic dressed up as intelligence. Perfect for pranks, portfolio fun, or weird hackathons.
